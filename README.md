# Intro

This implementation of k-means algorithm is made for execution time comparison wrt GPU accelerated version. You can check more details on [this repo](https://github.com/sim-pez/k_means_gpu)

# Generating dataset
```
python datasetgen.py N K STD
```
Where _N_ is the number of points, _K_ is the number of clusters and _STD_ is the standard deviation

# Plotting
```
python plot.py
```
