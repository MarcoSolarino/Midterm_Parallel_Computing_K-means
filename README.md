# Midterm_Parallel_Computing_K-means
This repository contains the midterm project for parallel computing course

## 1-Generating dataset
first you need to generate dataset
```
python datasetgen.py N K STD
```
where N is the number of points you want to generate, K is the number of clusters and STD is standard deviation of points from clusters, for example:
```
python datasetgen.py 1000 3 0.45
```
## 2-Run
You need to pass two arguments: number of clusters and number of iterations

## 3-Plotting
```
python plot.py
```
After running program you can plot result
